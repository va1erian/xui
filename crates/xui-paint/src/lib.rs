#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! `xui-paint`: a minimal MS-Paint-style doodler built on [`xui_core`].
//!
//! The crate is layered so the drawing logic runs anywhere `std` does, with no
//! window, no GPU and no file I/O:
//!
//! - [`model`] is pure logic: an RGBA [`model::Bitmap`], stroke rasterization,
//!   iterative flood fill, tools and a byte-bounded undo history. It uses no
//!   widget or backend type, so it is unit-tested with no `Ui`.
//! - [`view`] is the thin xui glue: a [`view::PaintApp`] with a custom canvas,
//!   a tool strip and a palette, mapping input events to [`view::Msg`] and from
//!   there into the model.
//! - [`storage`] is the optional persistence seam: [`storage::MemoryStorage`]
//!   (the default, used on a toy OS and in tests) and the feature-gated
//!   [`storage::FsStorage`].
//! - [`selftest`] runs a scripted doodle and prints PASS/FAIL, for hosts where
//!   `cargo test` is unavailable.
//!
//! The library depends on `xui-core` only. Backend selection lives in
//! `main.rs` behind the `canvas` feature (on by default). Running the app uses
//! no threads, timers, env vars, processes or filesystem (xui gap: G14), and
//! every action is reachable by mouse alone, so it stays usable when no font
//! renders (xui gap: G15). See `GAPS.md` for the full list.
