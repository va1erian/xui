//! [`DcCanvas`]: anti-aliased Direct2D drawing onto a raw `HDC`.
//!
//! Owner-drawn controls receive an `HDC` from `WM_DRAWITEM`/`WM_PAINT`, not a
//! window, so they cannot use a [`D2dSurface`](super::D2dSurface)
//! (`ID2D1HwndRenderTarget`). A `DcCanvas` binds an
//! `ID2D1DCRenderTarget` to that device context for one paint and exposes the
//! same primitives as [`D2dCanvas`](super::D2dCanvas); the shapes are
//! anti-aliased and composite over whatever GDI already painted (background,
//! text).
//!
//! The render target and its brushes are created once per thread and re-bound
//! per draw, so a control pays no device-resource cost per paint. Call
//! [`end_draw`](DcCanvas::end_draw) (or drop the canvas) before drawing with
//! GDI on the same device context.
