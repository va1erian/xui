#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Anti-aliased 2D drawing with Direct2D.
//!
//! GDI ([`crate::gdi`]) has no anti-aliasing or alpha. A [`D2dSurface`] binds
//! to any window; each frame, [`D2dSurface::begin_draw`] returns a
//! [`D2dCanvas`] whose shapes are anti-aliased, and [`D2dCanvas::end_draw`]
//! presents them. Coordinates are `f32` device-independent pixels (see
//! [`RectF`]); the surface applies the window's DPI, so the same code draws
//! correctly at 100% to 200% scaling.
//!
//! A window painted with Direct2D must not also be painted with GDI on the
//! same pixels: use a surface per owner-drawn child window.
//!
//! Thread affinity: a [`D2dSurface`] and its canvas belong to the UI thread
//! (they are neither `Send` nor `Sync`).
