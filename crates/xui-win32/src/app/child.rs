#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Secondary windows: non-modal [`open_window`](Ui::open_window) and modal
//! [`open_modal`](Ui::open_modal), plus the [`WindowHandle`] the opener keeps.
//!
//! Every window opened this way runs its own `App` with its own `Msg` type and
//! its own message queue, so its `update` is never re-entered (the same
//! invariant as the main window — see #33), while all windows share the one
//! process message loop. A non-modal window is owned by the opener (Windows
//! destroys it when the opener closes) but the opener keeps receiving input. A
//! modal window disables the opener, pumps messages until it closes, then
//! re-enables and reactivates the opener — in that order, so a disabled window
//! is not asked to come to the foreground.
