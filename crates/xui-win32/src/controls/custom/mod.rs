#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Custom owner-drawn widgets: the single owner-draw pattern every hand-rolled
//! child window in the crate uses.
//!
//! A [`CustomWidget`] is the application's view of a child window that paints
//! itself from semantic theme tokens and maps its input to typed [`Input`]
//! values. [`Custom`] owns the child `HWND` (and its window class), exposes the
//! widget through [`AsControl`]/[`Themed`], and maps the widget's [`CustomWidget::Event`]s
//! to the app's `Msg` through the same per-window queue as every other widget,
//! so [`App::update`](crate::App::update) is never re-entered.
