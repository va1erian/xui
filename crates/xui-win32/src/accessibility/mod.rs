//! Accessibility: what a widget tells assistive technology and UI Automation
//! clients (screen readers, test drivers, other agents).
//!
//! Native controls are exposed by Windows itself. A
//! [`CustomWidget`](crate::CustomWidget) paints its own pixels, so it
//! describes itself with a [`Node`] tree through
//! [`CustomWidget::accessibility`](crate::CustomWidget::accessibility) and
//! handles the [`Action`]s a client performs on it through
//! [`CustomWidget::accessibility_action`](crate::CustomWidget::accessibility_action).
//!
//! The tree is a *snapshot*: the widget builds it on demand, when a client
//! asks, so it can never go stale and holds no reference back to the widget.
//! A child is addressed by its path (the index chain from the root), which is
//! what an [`Action`] carries back.
