//! Proxy tests: worker threads feed the app through `Ui::proxy`, and sending
//! after the window is gone hands the message back instead of panicking.
//!
//! The wake-coalescing count itself (a burst posts one wake) is covered by the
//! in-crate unit tests in `src/app/proxy.rs`, which observe the post decision
//! directly; these integration tests prove every sent message still arrives
//! exactly once, in per-thread order.
