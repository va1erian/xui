#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Building the Rhai [`Engine`] a script is evaluated with, and
//! the host that runs a form's script against a live form.
//!
//! The feature set is fixed by the crate manifest: `debugging` for
//! breakpoints and call stacks (it implies `internals`, which [`EngineHost::prepare`]
//! uses), with `sync` deliberately absent so the engine keeps `Rc`.
//!
//! # How a script sees controls
//!
//! Rhai functions cannot see the enclosing scope, so `name_edit.text` inside
//! `fn hello_button_click()` would not resolve by itself. [`EngineHost`] installs an
//! [`Engine::on_var`] resolver that, for an unknown name, looks up the active
//! form's controls, then `form`, then the registered globals.
//!
//! The resolver *pushes the value into the scope* rather than returning it. A
//! value returned from `on_var` is marked read-only by Rhai, so a setter such as
//! `label.text = …` would fail with a "cannot modify property of constant"
//! error; a pushed variable is a normal mutable entry and the setter works.
//!
//! # The stdlib seam
//!
//! The engine built here is bare. A host plugs its own functions and globals in
//! through [`EngineSetup`]: an IDE passes its standard library, a plain xui app
//! passes `()` and registers whatever it needs.
//!
//! # Limits and stopping
//!
//! [`new_engine`] applies operation and call-depth limits. [`EngineHost`] adds
//! an [`Engine::on_progress`] hook: a per-run operation budget stops a runaway
//! handler, and [`EngineHost::stop`] lets the host (a Ctrl+Break, a debugger
//! pause) terminate a running script at the next progress check.
