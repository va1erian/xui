#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! The OS seam: everything the explorer needs from a filesystem and a shell.
//!
//! Both traits are object-safe and mention nothing but [`Path`], [`OsString`],
//! [`io::Result`] and [`SystemTime`]: no `xui` type, no `std::fs`, no `cfg`.
//! The portable core holds a `Rc<dyn Platform>` and a `Rc<dyn Launcher>`, so a
//! target such as LazyOS ports the explorer by implementing these two traits
//! (plus a [`Backend`](xui_core::backend::Backend)) and nothing else.
//!
//! Deletion never follows a symlink: [`Platform::remove`] removes the link
//! itself, and [`Platform::metadata`] reports a symlink as [`Kind::Symlink`]
//! rather than resolving it.
