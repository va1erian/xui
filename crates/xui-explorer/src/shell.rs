#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! The shared shell: the platform, the launcher and the window registry.
//!
//! [`Explorer`] owns a `Rc<dyn Platform>` and a `Rc<dyn Launcher>` and keeps
//! one entry per open folder window, so opening a folder that is already shown
//! is a no-op and deleting a folder can close the windows below it. There is no
//! raise/focus API in the portable layer, so a duplicate open reports
//! `"already open"` in the status bar instead of raising the existing window.
//!
//! The registry never holds its borrow across a call that can call back
//! (`open_window`, `close`, `send`): it collects what it needs, drops the
//! borrow, then acts. See [`registry`] for the map and its tests.
