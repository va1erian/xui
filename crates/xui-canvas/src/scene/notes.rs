#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! The scene mutations that change what is painted, each telling the window's
//! damage which rectangles it can have changed.
//!
//! A change dirties the node's *old and new* pixels: the part of the window its
//! painting (and its descendants') covered before, and the part it covers
//! after. That is the node's absolute bounds trimmed to its ancestors' clips,
//! for itself and every node inside it, hidden subtrees excluded. The damage
//! list grows each rectangle by the overdraw margin
//! ([`margin`](crate::compositor::margin)) when it is taken.
//!
//! The mutators return whether they changed anything, so a backend asks for a
//! frame only when one is owed.
